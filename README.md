A website I made in my very limited free time that can generate SPK's (License Server ID's) and LKP's (License Key Packs) for activating Remote Desktop Services and Client Access Licenses.

Heavily based on research done by my colleague, [WitherOrNot](https://github.com/WitherOrNot). You can see it [here](https://gist.github.com/WitherOrNot/c34c4c7b893e89ab849ce04e007d89a9). He is very smart. :)
